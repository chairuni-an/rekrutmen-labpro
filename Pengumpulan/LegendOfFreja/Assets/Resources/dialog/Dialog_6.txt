[Voice]{freja_5}{B01}{Q01}Thank you for coming to my party! Now please enjoy the food!>
[Voice]What a marvelous party! Especially the food>
[Voice]I heard that the priest have great taste of food, no wonder he able to serve many and delicious food like this>
[Voice]Look at other nobles, they seems enjoining the food>
[Voice]Hahaha let's enjoy the party!>
[]...>
[Child]{freja_7}Sister... I'm hungry...>
[Girl]You have be patience, Gil. Soon, mother will come back bringing us lot of food. Until that, you have to be patient>
[Child]Mom has gone for two month... You always said that since that time..>
[Girl]...>
[Girl]Here>
[Child]?>
[Girl]I don't know this would be enough for you, but you can eat this bread if you hungry>
[Child]But it yours. You don't hungry?>
[Girl]Hahaha I'm already adult so I'm hungry. You're still a kid, you have to eat a lot so you can become adult>
[Child]Is that true?>
[Girl]You don't believe your own sister?>
[Child]You always lied to me when I was kid...>
[Girl]You're still a kid! But I'm not lying now. So go ahead and eat>
[Child]Okay..>
[]...>
[Voice]It's not enough, bring more food!>
[Voice]Priest, you ate so many food. It's not good for your body to eat too much>
[Voice]And there're many people who suffer for starvation. I think it's better for you to give the food to them, as a priest>
[Voice]Don't you hear me? I want more food!>
[Voice]I don't care with them, it's not my business if they starve>
[Voice]My job is to bless them and pray for them, not giving my food!>
[Voice]Enough with the talk! Hurry up and bring me lots of food!>
[Voice]Sir...>
[Freja]{freja_4}...>
[Freja]{freja_3}{B00}No, that man is not a priest. That man shouldn't call him self as a human who became servant of the gods>
[Rowee]{Qbirdie}But it's the truth, missy>
[Rowee]There're lot of people like him, too many>
[Freja]{freja_9}...>
[Rowee]Even they starts with good will, once they get a power or good statues, they can misuse it and forget their good will or aim>
[Rowee]It always like that, since long ago and now>
[Rowee]The monster formed from the malice from gluttonous heart, 'Gula'. You released the sixth seal: 'Temperantia' or temperance>
[Freja]{freja_8}Malice...>
[Rowee]{freja_7}It is time to tell you about the 'overwhelming malice'>
[Freja]Please tell me>
[Rowee]As I mentioned before, this forest collects malice from entire of the world and keeping them in here>
[Freja]{freja_10}To protect the world from overwhelming malice>
[Rowee]{freja_5}Yes. And those malice came from human's evil heart, human's sins>
[Freja]Sins...>
[Rowee]The seals posses power to seal and purify them. The closer the seal is with the malice, the power of purification will get stronger>
[Rowee]The purification can't be done in blink, it needs time. The time will be longer when the malice gets stronger>
[Rowee]Long time ago when I became a guardian, the malice that gathered in this place was not too strong>
[Rowee]The seal could purified it in short time and it didn't became monster>
[Rowee]It's not because the forest couldn't able to collect the malice. The forest's power didn't change since the beginning and now>
[Freja]{freja_1}So you mean that malice that came from human's heart was lesser that now?>
[Rowee]{freja_5}Yes, that right>  
[Rowee]You can see now there is monster near an unreleased seal. Powerful malice need a long time to be purified, moreover if it can form a physical body>
[Rowee]The trial is meant to purify the malice that can't be purified by the seal in short time, and making this forest untainted for a time so the book will appear>
[Rowee]The forest has keeping too many malice. Not all of malice can be contained in this place>
[Rowee]And those that can't be contained, become Karluh, the 'wave'>
[Freja]{freja_3}!!!>
[Rowee]{freja_4}Karluh was formed from the overwhelming malice>
[Rowee]Malice that came from various hearts of humans>
[Rowee]Karluh is like a miasma, looks like a purple gas>
[Rowee]Anybody who make physical contact with it, they body will be turned into stone, gradually>
[Rowee]Well, it actually a magic force and the disease's like a curse. A powerful curse>
[Rowee]{freja_7}So no wonder if no body can cure it>
[Freja]....>
[Rowee]The only way to stop this is by using the book of Maeral>
[Rowee]That's thing you about to do>
[Freja]{freja_10}... If I use the book, the wave can be stopped for now. But...>
[Rowee]Yes. As long as human exist, even you able to stop the wave, in near or distant future is will appeared again>
[Freja]Because the malice came from human's heart>
[Rowee]I don't know where's the legend came from, but Maeral's power only can be used to purify all of malice, inside and outside of humans heart, in entire of the world>
[Freja]{freja_8}So the legend about granting founder's any wish is not true?>
[Rowee]No, it's not. But in your case, yes. You want to use that book to stop all of this, right>
[Freja]{freja_4}Yes>
[Rowee]Maeral will grant your wish. But to using Maeral's power, it comes with great cost>
[Freja]{freja_1}Cost?>
[Rowee]{freja_5}Soul>
[Rowee]{freja_9}Thar's why I told you that you will not able to go to your home if you tried to get the book>
[Rowee]You saw a vision about Kalluga before. It may happened to you>
[Rowee]When you released the next seal, you can get the book and use it>
[Rowee]You came this far, but since you're Maiden, you still can turn back>
[Freja]{freja_4}...No, I will proceed>
[Rowee]Are you sure? Your effort may end in vain>
[Freja]If I stops here, then all of the effort I have done will ends in vain for sure>
[Freja]I have seen lot of misery because of the wave or malice>
[Freja]{freja_8}I don't want to see it anymore. If I turn back now, I will regret it for entire of my life>
[Freja]Maybe, this tragedy will be repeat in some time in the future>
[Freja]{freja_17}But, I live in present>
[Freja]I want to save present>
[Freja]And I believe that if we not able to save the present, there will be no future>
[Rowee]...>
[Freja]{freja_13}Even I hate my duty as Maiden, I still hate to see misery like this>
[Freja]I hate seeing grief or sorrow in people's eyes>
[Freja]I'm full of that>
[Freja]And there was many time when they helped me, saved me. The world raise me up until now>
[Freja]{freja_15}It's time for me to do something for this world>
[Freja]Beside, I don't want to feel guilty or regret>
[Rowee]...If it your decision, I won't disagree it now>
[Rowee]It's been a while since the last time I saw people like you>
[Rowee]Alright, let's go, missy>
[Rowee]The next will be the last, so get ready>
[Freja]{freja_15}Okay>
[Freja]{freja_9}...>
[Freja]{freja_16}Okay!>
