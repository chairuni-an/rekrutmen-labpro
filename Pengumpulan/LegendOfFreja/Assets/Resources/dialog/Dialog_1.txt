[Freja]{B00}!!>
[Rowee]{freja_8}{Qbirdie}Get grip, missy!>
[Freja]Rowee...?>
[Freja]What... was that...? An illusion...?>
[Rowee]It's was an illusion. But unfortunately, it also the vision of past>
[Freja]Past... You mean that-->
[Rowee]It's a real event that occurred in the past. In a village called Morde>
[Rowee]What was you watching was the event when a Maiden, Patientia, was killed by the villager that controlled by their wrath because of the crisis in their village>
[Freja]Patientia...>
[Rowee]{freja_7}She was a fine, kind-hearted woman>
[Rowee]She always prioritize other people than herself. Whenever and wherever she is, Patientia always help other people and pray for them>
[Rowee]When she was killed, her lover, a man called Norr went rage and killed all people in that village>
[Rowee]The monster you defeat before is a lump of sins and evil things that produced by humans>
[Freja]....>
[Rowee]Now, you showed me your power and I think you deserved to take this trial>
[Freja]{freja_10}What do you mean?>
[Rowee]{freja_5}Well, I was testing you that you're a real Maiden or not. Human usually cannot touch that monster, but they can touch human>
[Rowee]Normally they will killed by the monster because of that>
[Rowee]Except for the Maiden>
[Rowee]Only the Maiden can purify them and defeat them>
[Rowee]The Maiden of Cardinal. A human girl that tasked by gods to maintain the nature balance of the world>
[Rowee]If you killed by the monster, then you're not the Maiden and my hunch is wrong. But if you able to defeat it, then I will help you to get the book>
[Rowee]Well, looks like the result is 'I have to help you' though. You're from Verthia, then it makes you the Maiden of North> 
[Freja]{freja_17}Guess I cannot hide my true self from Griffin, isn't it?>
[Rowee]{freja_14}Oh, it's too soon for that!>
[Rowee]{freja_5}Now I will explain you the detail of the trial>
[Rowee]You know that book of Maeral is a sacred book that created in the time of 'beginning'>
[Rowee]The time where civilization didn't exist yet>
[Rowee]The time where evil or sin still not exist>
[Rowee]That book is supported by seven seals, the 'Seven Virtue'. It said that the first generation of human learned virtues from the seals>
[Rowee]If you want to get the book, you have to release all of the seals>
[Rowee]In the age of beginning, the seals was always released because the world wa still pure and untainted>
[Rowee]But when human start to exist and build up the civilization, means 'sins' start to exist, the 'Seven Virtue' gradually shut them self to protect the book from the malice>
[Rowee]To keep the book from humans and keep the world from overwhelming malice, this seals calls the malice from the seven great sins into this place>
[Freja]{freja_10}Overwhelming malice...>
[Rowee]{freja_5}The lump of malice become a monster like the one you defeat. Each seal is related to certain lump of sin>
[Rowee]That big guy was formed from 'Ira', wrath> 
[Rowee]The wrath of people like Norr and that villagers come to this place and become one, forming that big-guy>
[Rowee]When you purify 'Ira', one of the seal: 'Patientia' that represent patience is released>
[Rowee]All you have to do is repeat what you did before until the seventh seal>
[Rowee]Remember that the seal is released only when the corresponding monster is purified>
[Rowee]The monster always stays near the seal, but it's only appeared when the previous seal is released>
[Freja]{freja_1}That means that I have to release the seal in order?>
[Rowee]{freja_5}Yea t'right, missy>
[Rowee]As a guardian, the only thing that can tell you is the order of the seal. I can't do more than that>
[Freja]{freja_16}Its okay, it really helps me>
[Freja]{freja_9}That vision...>
[Freja]It will appeared again when I release other seal, wouldn't it?>
[Rowee]Yes. Just brace yourself, missy>
[Rowee]{freja_5}Okay-kay, enough with chit-chat. Let's go to the next seal, missy>
[Freja]{freja_1}Yes>
[Freja]{freja_9}....>
[Freja]{freja_10}Vision, huh> 
[]{0}Now you can save the game by pressing X key near the seal of 'Patientia'>
